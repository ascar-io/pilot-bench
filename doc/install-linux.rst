Installation on Linux
*********************

We prebuild binary packages for the following Linux distributions.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux / CentOS 7
===================================

Installing the nightly repo configuration file and use yum to install
the pilot-bench package:

.. code-block:: bash

   rpm -ihv https://download.ascar.io/pub/repo/ascar-repo-nightly.rpm
   yum install pilot-bench


Ubuntu 16.04 LTS x86-64
=======================

Coming soon.

Other Linux

Coming soon.


Currently we do not have resources to build and test on other versions
or distributions. If you are willing to help, please let us know!
