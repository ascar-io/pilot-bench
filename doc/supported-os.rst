Supported OSes
**************

Our current roadmap is to support the latest versions of the popular
flavors of UNIX/Linux, including Mac OS X. If you need to run Pilot on
Windows or other embedded systems, please send us an email on the
`users mailing list`_.

Currently we support Pilot on the following operating systems:

1. Red Hat Enterprise Linux / CentOS 7 (gcc 4.8.5 and gcc 7.2.1 from `devtoolset-7`_)

The following OSes are supported on a best effort basis:

1. Mac OS X Version 10.11 El Capitan (Apple LLVM version 7.3.0 (clang-703.0.29))
2. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS x86-64 (gcc 5.3.1-14ubuntu2)

Pilot should work on most Linux systems that have a C++ compiler that
can compile Boost.  Users have reported successful build on Arch and
Fedora.  Please feel free to send an email to the `users mailing
list`_ to share your experience if you have tested Pilot on other
systems.
