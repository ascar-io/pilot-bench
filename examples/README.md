This directory contains example benchmarks that make use of
Pilot. There are tutorials on the Pilot wiki that explain these
examples: https://github.com/ascar-io/pilot-bench/wiki

To compile these samples, run:

# ./make.sh

You will need to either have the Pilot library installed or compile it
from the source code. Read
https://github.com/ascar-io/pilot-bench/wiki/Requirements%20and%20Installation%20Instructions
for instructions.
